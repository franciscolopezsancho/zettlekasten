There are two models to look at economics.  
State money - Where money comes from its printing by the Government 
Private money - Where money represent goods

Both are right in certain scope and the central Bank has both. It's a hibrid. 
It's a bank for other banks dealing with money as private. Providing back up for banks to give loans when they lack deposits. Some other times it's a government bank, helping to sell gevernment bonds.
