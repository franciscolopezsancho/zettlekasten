A way of defining counting from set theory is pairing against an official set. A set that contains nothing, i.e. zero, one that contains the one that contains nothings, namely one. On so forth.  All this while pairing being bijective. 
Infinity is defined counting all the natural numbers (pairing) against each set and then wrap that pairing with a superset. Thereâ€™s a difference between the recursive algorithm used to add one more vs. the operation of inclusion of one set inside the other. This allows pairing the increasing algorithm of natural numbers with the one with sets plus adding an extra operation. Inclusion.
