A fish is a survival machine that preserves certain genes. It's important to point out that to be precise is not about genes but any DNA structure that creates proteins and persists over long periods of time. DNA not only is a replicator is a protein builder, should be reminded at this point. Nature favors replicators that build good survival machines.
While these pieces of it that don't get to the size of a gene but already produce proteins are called Cistrons. From Cistrons to Genes and anything in between is what this book talks about. Mendel already pointed to indivisible particles of replication.
