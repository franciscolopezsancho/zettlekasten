A way to approach the problem special relativity tries to solve is the fact puzzling thought that nobody can hold a light beam in its hand. It doesn't matter how fast you go, nothing can move at the same par with light. It's a constant. Like zero degree celsius?? There's no way to simulate what happens when two trains move at the same speed and direction.
