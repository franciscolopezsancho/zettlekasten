General relativity, like Einstein confessed, starts with the puzzle of a man falling from a building and emptying his pockets along the way. From his point of view, gravity has been canceled. 
Also if falling along with let's say a whole house and a beam of light crosses the room in a straight line for the falling dweller. From outside this will be seen as a curve on the light's trajectory. 
The last thought is a man in the space floating. He will feel gravity if his spaceship accelerates in any direction. 
These three facts show that acceleration and gravity if not the same, they are interchangeable. This questions bothered Einstein to find a solution.
