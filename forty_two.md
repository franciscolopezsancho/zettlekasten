42 an interesting joke

Just found in a Richard Feynman [lecture](https://youtu.be/j3mhkYbznBk?t=2891) that there's 42 digits in the relation between electormagnetic force and gravitational one (G/e). And there's also this magnitude in the relation of the size of the universe and a proton, but it's true that the size of the universe is actually increasing. 

The thing is in this [article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/yes-the-answer-to-the-universe-really-is-42-1351201.html) states that Douglas Adams confessed it was just the most boring number he could found. I thought it a bit, and that is that.
