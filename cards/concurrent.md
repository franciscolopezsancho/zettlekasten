concurrent is in Merrian-Webster as its basic sense "operating or ocurring at the same time" but also contains convergence as one of the meanings. In Spanish RAE is somehow more helpful, its first sense is "said about the different people, events or things that meet at a same place or time". Now from Herlihy the informal definition is "a concurrent system is a collection of sequential processes that communicate through shared typed objects". From these I take away that a concurrent system is such as composed by interleaving processes communicate through shared objects. 

And it adds it works for shared data or message passing architectures.
