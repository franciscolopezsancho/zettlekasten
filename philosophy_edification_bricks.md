Can I relate philosophy concepts, theories as mathematical categories? 2000 years later again using the same gist. Mathematics to do philosophy. I guess this lead to the question if thinking is logical. Or mathematical…
Or probably, if probability is a superset of philosophy, none of them. What else could it be?
I’m thinking maybe not from basic concepts, or sets of operations. I could imagine that neurocience could throw some more lively ideas. Situation, context, reaction.
