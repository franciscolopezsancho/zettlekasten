Trying to add one to infinity may not be wise:
inf + 1 = Inf => (Inf - Inf) = 1 => 0 = 1
This show us that we should be careful how we think this through. So let’s go to Hilbert’s hotel where is a good place to start. 
Having an infinity rooms hotel if one new guest come you may ask each guest move his room one up. See how this is now an algorithm. This is how to go about it.
Also you could add Inf guest to this hotel too by ask everyone to move 2n up and each new guest to 2n -1.
