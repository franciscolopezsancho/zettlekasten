CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) came about to override the “Classes” A/B/C type of networks on 32-bits. Such as “a.b.c.d”. Where B defined a subnetwork holding 64256 ips, too many for most of organizations, while C 254 were to few. 
Under the rapid growth of internet classless came about substituting those classes for the slash after the IP that would divide the size of the subnetwork with much more precision. i.e. a.b.c.d/28 would give a 16 hosts.
