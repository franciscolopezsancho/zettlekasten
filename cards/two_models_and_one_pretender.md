macroeconomics models are:
- NIPA: “national income and product accounts” where GDP = C + I + (X − M) + G
Consumption, Investment, Net Exports and Government expenditures.
- QTM: “quantity  theory of money”: where MV equals PT. 
Money, Velocity (or avg frecuency of all transactions), Price level and Transactions aggregate

But there’s also another school with balance sheets but no way to make a model out of it.
