Time is different in four levels: 
1. time pases equally: not true, as in a mountain that in the sea level. 
2. There is a common now. not true, as in the now you and I say it is. You being in Jupiter my now is not yours. Now has meaning in as the speed of light plus a 10th of a second, this time is the min amount of time we can resolve. This bring the question what is real if there's not now. 
3. Past is different from the future. Not true in any main theory of physics with one exception. 2nd law of thermodynamics. This that in isolated system entropy can't decrease over TIME. It depends in from how you define order on the system. But the difference between past of the future you need heat. 
4. Time is discrete and if we measure it at the quantum level superposition would make impossible to speak about time at all.
