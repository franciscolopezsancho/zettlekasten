upper case) is not a genus. 

Going up from a thing to its genus recursively could provide the Max Genus, The Being, but in any case you would have to define it at the end of the chain, as nothing can contain it. By definition. Recursive definition, actually. 
Therefore once up there weâ€™ll find we can't not defined it, as no concept can be up above but also because is not a thing, an entity. Which lead us to the second point.
We must use it everywhere, anything you point at has to be. But Being doesn't point to a thing, or his mode of existence. Being is its assumption, the ground from where we point to the thing. Everytime we try to point to it, seems it keeps laying behind.
