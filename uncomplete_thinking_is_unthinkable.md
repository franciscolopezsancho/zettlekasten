A thought may be uncomplete as: “Steve unveiled the....”
Thought is not complete as a definition of a  function such as  “from x to…”
Thought can't be uncompleted. If not final specific limit is put, a generic one will put in its place. Otherwise nothing can't be thought at all. Syntetic, Analitic?
Is this putting a generic actually getting a step back and looking at the overall generic of the thought itself?
