Money has at least for layers, hierarchical. 
Gold -> currency -> deposit -> credit
And in between these layer we have actors
Central Bank-> Retailer Bank -> Market dealers
And  also actions, transformations
      exchange rate -> par -> interest rate

The economy goes up and down this chain. Breathes. When grows goes downwards, when shrinks wants back to Gold.
