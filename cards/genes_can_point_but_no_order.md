Behavior is shaped from MILLION of YEARS per selfish gene, per kin-selection, per reciprocal selection. But not quite (and this is the motto of all the talk) This would not explain sects don't reproduce, adoption and being gentle with people you'll never see again. 

When you judge behavior take all these levels into account. And remember behavior can change at any moment as per great individuals as John Newton and hist opposition to slavery,  Zeniy Abe in Pearl Harbor, Hugh Thomson in Mi Lar massacre or in Christmas Trus in WWI.

Those who don't study history won't be able to repeat it.
