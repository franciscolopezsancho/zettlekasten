Illumination? What does it even mean? This is not an idea that can tell you what THE truth is or the reality for that matter. That is mysticism after all. You may train for it thought. Training to let yourself see the reality as it is, so eventually illumination can happen. And maybe that happens when you meditate and  realize that is already there. It's by dropping that mental barrier when then the light, that has always been there, gets through. Maybe is not such a bad name, after all, as long you take it with a fairly sized pinch of salt.
