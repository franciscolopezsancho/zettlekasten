Dasein, being in the world is not to be as a thing, an independent object that can be in some possible add-on or relation with something is essentially out of it. We are in the world in the same way a thing is. All of us are out there mingling, without a breaking-point between us and the other. There are structures and relations and is in them how we come into existence. Thereâ€™s no more to it. This brings the question now how can relations get born.
