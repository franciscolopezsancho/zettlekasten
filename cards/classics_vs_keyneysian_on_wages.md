Classic macroeconomics assumed that surplus of unemployment would make decrease the wages. That didn't happen on 20 years in Europe and U.S. around the 30s. In between Keynes spread the idea that that assumption was wrong. Wages don't go  down. For a few reasons. One of them, employees have power of negotiation. NewKeynesians with a bit more data showed that worker would work harder to keep their jobs if is above market level. But this is perspective is not macroeconomics. Is somethings else.
