A function in Set theory takes a value and gives you another value, this is represented as an arrow in category theory. It can't be defined in terms of transforming elements, as there's no such is this model. How do we prove they compose, then? What's the method used?
I reckon that is generalizing from Sets to Categories, to define basic truths, recombine them, and go back to lower models as Set themselves, or Rings to check the inference is valid.
