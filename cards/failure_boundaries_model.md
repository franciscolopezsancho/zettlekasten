Rasmussen systems model depicts the boundaries of every system, its boundaries respect failure. There are three lines that intersect, accident, economic viability and workload exhaustion. If we imagine a selfdriving car we may easily think about a road accident, regards economic could be not making the car production sustainable, and regards workload running out of fuel.
Over this boundaries we put imaginary margins intended to prevent crossing the boundaries but inexorably we keep pushing the margin until it has consecuences. That is, when we cross again the boundary.
Old models tend to focus in reliabilty and control, asking why are the reasons for failure. Better model focus in monitoring and counter measures, tranforming the question to how are they working. I have control of a system not by prediction but by capacity to change it on timely fashion. This they call resilience.
