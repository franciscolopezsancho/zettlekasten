Illumination? What does it even mean? There's not an idea that can tell you what THE truth is or the reality for that matter. That's mysticism after all. You may train for it thought. Training to let the reality get in so eventually that can happen. And maybe that happens as when you meditate and you let enter what is already entering. Is when you drop that mental barrier when then the light, that has always been there, gets through. Maybe is not such a bad name, after all, as long you take it with a fairly sized pinch of salt.
