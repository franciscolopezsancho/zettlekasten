Is the empty set a subset of any Set? Yes because each element in of the empty set is in A. Namely none. But if you think it this way you can not actually think about it. You're brain process freezes. How can you continue referring to "each element of the empty set". This points to nothing. This forces you to take a step back and realize what you're doing. Out of the Mathematical realm of course. That's why I'm taking now about thinking and not sets. 

You could say though. There's no element in the empty set you will not find in any Set. That's why it is a subset of any Set. This make me think that subset should also be defined in this way to any other subset.  Such as A is a subset of B. If there's no element in A that is not in B.
