ADTs are so because the can be defined through product and sum and represent solving equations. Which is algebra after all.
If product can be thought as the creation of pairs, while sum as the creation of the union of two types. Either this or that. 
This formula:
 l(a) = 1 + a * l(a) => List[A] = List.empty | (Const A,  List[A])

The algebra of the left is equivalent to the definition of a type on the right. The definition of the type is done by the means of an algebra of the sum and the product.
