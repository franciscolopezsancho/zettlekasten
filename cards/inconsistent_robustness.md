We've been dreaming with consistency as a barrier that protect us from the unknown but that's all it is. A dream. Thinking about the government, or any big corporation for that matter we can find they are full of inconsistencies, so it is our knowledge of the nature. But if we stick to the organizations and think it through the Cornway's Law, where we design software similar in structure to the company's, we can admit that in the best of the world we have a great organizations that scale, are failure tolerant and robust. Inconsistent but robust. It would be more clear to think our software systems under this lenses, let's agree to disagree an move forward and up.
