Consistency many times we thought it through the perspective of logic, a system is consistent while not being contradictory. Quite often when we think this as a property also of software systems, thus we expect its coherence. But if we put in the middle the necessary hardware for this to happen we may find physics tell us reality is inconsistent. What happens there only relates to here after it travels the distance, no faster than the speed of light. The information a gather tells me how the past was but I cannot know what is now if is not here.
