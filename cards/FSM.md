A finite state machine is a graph with an initial node and a bunch of others that can be an accepted. This can be thought as accepted goals. The idea is to traverse this nodes with a finite expression written with a finite set of symbols. Each node will allow certain transitions to specific nodes for a specific symbol of that expression.

A language is a set, and can be infinite, of the expressions. It's said a language is recognized on a FSM when all it's expressions are accepted in that FSM.

FSM can also be defined through a Regular Expresssions and Regular Languages
