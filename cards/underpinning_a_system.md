What is a system? doesn't look like an entity, there's nothing you can underpin. Let's put an example. How humans interact with nature in order to survive. There's a system of actors, actions and effects that relate to each other in a level is not measurable. We may create a model or a law, so we may said we discover it. But in anycase we can not touch, nor measure the model, only its parts. 
the models don't exist but they are, same as number 2.
