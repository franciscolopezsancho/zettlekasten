Observational equivalence looks at the correctness in a program, defining it as known inputs and expected outputs. This is runtime though, the program in movement. One level deeper is treating the written program as inputs and outputs itself, this is: Session Types. This will give as in compile time the correctness of the posible order of the messages. Proving it falls under a defined protocol...   
Meanwhile we will have to be satisfied with messages and FSMs.
