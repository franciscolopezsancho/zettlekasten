Most firms make payments with bills. This is promise to pay in X days in the future. These bills mostly end into banks that act as a market dealers. The can give back for these bills, notes, deposit or acceptances. This last ones are also promises to pay but from the bank. Where less interest is applied, less that with notes or debit.
The notes <-> bills flow is call discounts, when done from Firms to Banks. When that is done among banks is call rediscount. This is management of liquidity.
