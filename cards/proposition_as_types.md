lamda calculus definition:
variables =>            L, M, N :== x
funtion definitions =>           | (Î»x.N)
a funcion aplicationn =>         | (L M)

To simplify M or N could be read as function or as a type or a proposition. All those x that have some properties   

L, M and N are terms while x is a variable
x.M should be read like M is term, M is a function with input of type x 
(M N) should be read as 


propositions as types
proofs as programs
simplifications as executions
