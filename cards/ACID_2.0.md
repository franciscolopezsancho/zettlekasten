Usually ACID is all about state, historically comes from databases, but if we think about operations as opposed to state we may define ACID as Associativity, Commutativity, Idemmoptency and Distributed. The latter means reordering of the operations. Seems to me that now CRDT come to the rescue but, Am I thinking in state againg and therefore back again to the same point? Or may I call this a circumnavigation with a closer radius? Same point but one feet under.
