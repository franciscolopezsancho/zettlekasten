Infrastructure as code is old news now we have infraestructure as data. Desired state and current, that defines your infrastructure. 
 Monads also abstract functions as data. Instead of reason about runtime, the execution, what input and what output I get from combining functions, we can reason against a static data structure, the chain it self. We can test the chain has the links we expected. 
 One reminder though, from Alan Kay, data structures and algorithms are a too low level abstraction, they don't scale. You can not build systems as this as your semantics. At least large systems, as almost any living creature.
