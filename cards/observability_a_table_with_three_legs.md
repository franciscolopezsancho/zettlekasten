The three pillars of observability are **not enough** to make a table. Log, metrics and traces are just data types. The missing leg is the what you do with it. Which is setting goals and its means. 

Goals are defined in Service Level Indicators that can show you improvement in the system or a sudden decrease.
The means to achieve this should be the discovery of the specific SLI that will provide such an insight and it’s refinement through the measure of it’s very variance in correlation with each deployment.
