f you want to tell something, start tell a story the listener can relate to. Find the key, the three keys you want to remember, no fluff. And apply these simple techniques, memory palace, don’t hide  behind podiums, get louder 20%, start strong, don’t pet hamsters, acknowledge the obvious, act out the characters instead of describe them, and never finish with Q&A. 

Ps. a punchline is like 1… 2.. 4
